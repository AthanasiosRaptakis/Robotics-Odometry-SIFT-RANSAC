# Robotics-Odometry-SIFT-RANSAC
Robotics Odometry and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) The trajectory of a moving robot was estimated by optical information acquired from an attached camera. Initially features were extracted with SIFT transform and then the RANSAC algorithm was used in order to determine the optimal affine transformation between consecutive frames.
